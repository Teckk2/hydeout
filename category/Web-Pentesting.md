  Owasp Top-10 2013-2017
</h1>

<br>If you are new to web-pentesting and eager to learn and practice **OWASP Top 10**, I recommend first download [XVWA](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/xtreme-vulnerable-web-application-xvwa-1,209/), [Owasp-WebGoat](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/releases/tag/7.1) and visit [Altoro Mutual](http://www.altoromutual.com) which is set up by IBM to test **IBM Appscan** and is vulnerable to all Owasp TOP (2013). As I have demonstrated the vulnerabilities using these Resources. So going along through my blogs you can also practice and learn.
