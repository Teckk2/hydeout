<br>So let me clarify one thing straight away, after trying a lot of thing me and KNX was not be able to solve this binary in the intended way, although we are able to do that by manipulating the internal function of the application using FRIDA which is equivalent to Cheating, so the main focus of this blog is to show what are the mistakes and all the FAIL attempt we did and what all things we learned from our journey.
