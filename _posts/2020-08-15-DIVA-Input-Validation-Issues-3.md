<br>We reached to our final challenge in this the objective is to do DOS the application and crash it
<br>![13-1](https://teckk2.github.io/assets/images/DIVA/13-1.png)
<br>As the hint mention that this is a classic example of memory corruption or stack based buffer overflow
<br>![13-2](https://teckk2.github.io/assets/images/DIVA/13-2.png)
<br>As you can see there is strcpy function available in the library of the application, so letâ€™s try with something simple to understand where we are
<br>![13-3](https://teckk2.github.io/assets/images/DIVA/13-3.png)
<br>Generate a string of Aâ€™s and feed it inside the application to see the response in Logcat
<br>**AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA**
<br>![13-4](https://teckk2.github.io/assets/images/DIVA/13-4.png)
<br>Now push the red button
<br>![13-5](https://teckk2.github.io/assets/images/DIVA/13-5.png)
<br>And you will notice the application crashed successfully, basically the challenge finished at this stage, but I decided to go ahead and take a reverse shell, which turn out to be the worst decision for me ðŸ˜‚, as expected Android binary exploitation should be similar what we expirience in a normal linux machine, untill unless you are using a ARM based architecture which is slightly different, but that was my mistake to think like that, becasue the application was coustom build and have lot of restriction which I had never experienced, and later as usual my mentor [**KNX**](https://twitter.com/KNX69144506?s=09) came to rescue me from this hell ðŸ˜‚. I have shared my overall experience in the next Blog [Binary from Hell]()
