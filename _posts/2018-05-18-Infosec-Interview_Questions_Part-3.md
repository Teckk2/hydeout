  <font color="Black">Question 1</font> â€“ On which layer Nmap works?
</p>
<br>**Ans**:- 
br>{_Small and simple answer_} 
  * Nmap works on Two layers Network (Layer 3) and Transport (Layer 4)
<br>{_If they ask for more In-depth answer_} 
  * Nmap Use Network layer to send packets , and for detecting whether the host is Up or not.
  * Transport Layer is used for SYN scan and also to detect which ports are open/closed.
  * Sequence number detection also happens in Transport Layer which is used to detect the OS of the target.
