</p>
<br>**Ans**:- 
<br>{_**Small and simple answer**_} 
  * Nmap works on Two layers Network (Layer 3) and Transport (Layer 4)

<br>{_**If they ask for more In-depth answer**_} 
  * Nmap Use Network layer to send packets , and for detecting whether the host is Up or not.
  * Transport Layer is used for SYN scan and also to detect which ports are open/closed.
  * Sequence number detection also happens in Transport Layer which is used to detect the OS of the target.
