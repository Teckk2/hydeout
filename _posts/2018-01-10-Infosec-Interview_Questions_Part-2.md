This Part of the **(InfoSec Interview Questions)** blog has some senario based questions hope you all like it.

  <font color="Black">Question 1</font> – When running an NMAP scan what is the techniques for avoiding Firewalls ?
</p>

<br>**Ans**:- As a penetration tester you will come across with systems that are behind firewalls and they are blocking you from getting the information that you want.So you will need to know how to avoid the firewall rules that are in place and to discover information about a host.This step in a penetration testing called Firewall Evasion Rules.
<p>Nmap has different options to :-</p>
  
  * <font color="Black">1)  Fragment Packets:-</font> 
    This technique was very effective especially in the old days however you can still use it if you found a firewall that is not properly configured.The Nmap offers that ability to fragment the packets while scanning with the -f option so it can bypass the packet inspection of firewalls.

  * <font color="Black">2)	Specify a specific MTU:-</font>
    * Nmap is giving the option to the user to set a specific MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) to the packet.This is similar to the packet fragmentation technique that we have explained above.
    * During the scan that size of the nmap will create packets with size based on the number that we will give.In this example we gave the number 24 so the nmap will create 24-byte packets causing a confusion to the firewall.Have in mind that the MTU number must be a multiple of 8 (8,16,24,32 etc).  
    * You can specify the MTU of your choice with the command –mtu number target.
  <br><font color="red">root@kali</font>:<font color="RoyalBlue">~/Desktop</font># nmap –mtu 24 192.168.1.50
  
  * <font color="Black">3)	Use Decoy addresses:-</font>
  In this type of scan you can instruct Nmap to spoof packets from other hosts.In the firewall logs it will be not only our IP address but also and the IP addresses of the decoys so it will be much harder to determine from which system the scan started.There are two options that you can use in this type of scan:-
    * <font color="red">root@kali</font>:<font color="RoyalBlue">~/Desktop</font># nmap -D RND:10 [target] (Generates a random number of decoys)
    * <font color="red">root@kali</font>:<font color="RoyalBlue">~/Desktop</font># nmap -D decoy1,decoy2,decoy3 etc. (Manually specify the IP addresses of the decoys)
    <br><font color="red">root@kali</font>:<font color="RoyalBlue">~/Desktop</font># nmap –D 192.168.1.40,192.168.1.45 192.168.1.50
    
  * <font color="Black">4)	Idle Zombie Scan:-</font>
    
    * This technique allows you to use another host on the network that is idle in order to perform a port scan to another host.The main advantage of this method is that it very stealthy because the firewall log files will record the IP address of the Zombie and not our IP.However in order to have proper results we must found hosts that are idle on the network.
    
    * Metasploit framework has a scanner that can help us to discover hosts that are idle on the network and it can be used while implementing this type of scan.
    <br>msf > use auxiliary/scanner/ip/ipidseq
    <br>msf auxiliary(<font color="red">ipidseq</font>) > set RHOST 192.168.1.2-192.168.1.50
    
    * using this scanner you can find which IP is idle in the network and are potential candidate for use on an idle Zombie Scan. In order to implement an Idle Zombie scan we need to use the command :-
    
    <br><font color="red">root@kali</font>:<font color="RoyalBlue">~/Desktop</font># nmap -sI [Zombie IP] [Target IP]
