<br>While setting up the environmenty and solving DIVA, I did few reddendent steps and followed a long way becasue my objective was not just to solve the app and show you, but to learn more and more methods and the mistaked I did while solving this. So if you don't like any step or part, feel free to skip it.
<br>Let's start by downloading [DIVA APK](http://www.payatu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/diva-beta.tar.gz) from the official site of [Payatu](https://www.payatu.com/).
<br>Then we need to download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) to emulate our Android phone.

<br>When you open your APK make sure it install SDK or if doesnâ€™t do itself, just close the project and reopen again, or find a manual way to do it
