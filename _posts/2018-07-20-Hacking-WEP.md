<p>Before we start attacknig WEP let's learn about it's history a bit. (WEP) stands for Wired Equivalent Privacy, which is a security protocol, specified in the IEEE Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) standard, 802.11b, that is designed to provide a wireless local area network (WLAN) with a level of security and privacy comparable to what is usually expected of a wired LAN.</p>

<br>**WEP** Uses RC4 stream cipher and 64-or 128-bit keys. Static master key must be manually entered into each device.
<br>WEP was introduced in 1999. Within a few years, several security researchers discovered flaws in its design. The "24 additional bits of system-generated data" mentioned above is technically known as the Initialization Vector and proved to be the most critical protocol flaw. With simple and readily available tools, a hacker can determine the WEP key and use it to break into an active Wi-Fi network within a matter of minutes.

<p>Vendor-specific enhancements to WEP like WEP+ and Dynamic WEP were implemented in attempts to patch some of the shortcomings of WEP, but these technologies are also not viable today.</p>
<br>Let's now setup our lab and for which I am going to use a Linksys08362 and Linksys47370 or you can use any wifi router which offers WEP/WPA/WPA2/WPA2-Enterprise and we need a Kali, and a Wifi adapter which should have Packet injection capability, And for that I am using TP-Link TL-WN722N.

<br> Go to your Wifi router setting and configure it to WEP,
![WEP-1](https://teckk2.github.io/assets/images/Wifi/1.1.PNG)
<br>There you will see two options one to create encryption keys with **40 / 64-bit (10 hex digits)** and one with **104 / 128-bit (26 hex digits)** this is the security feature which they added before WPA was formally adopted in 2003. This option is not available in many routers/old.

<br>As you can see in our wifi adapter which is **Wlan0** the mode is showing: Managed and to dump the data from the envirement and for packet injection or to do other stuff we need **Monitor** Mode and to do that we can use a beautiful set of tool airmon-ng which will set out wifi adpater to monitor mode.

<font size="1">
<div style="height:300px;width:600px;overflow:auto;background-color:#262626;color:White;scrollbar-base-color:gold;font-family:monospace;padding:10px;">
<p><font color="red">root@kali</font>:<font color="RoyalBlue">~/Desktop</font># airmon-ng start wlan0</p>

<p>Found 3 processes that could cause trouble.
<br>If airodump-ng, aireplay-ng or airtun-ng stops working after
<br>a short period of time, you may want to run 'airmon-ng check kill'</p>

</div>
</font>

<br>Now as you can see the Mode has been chnaged to Monitor and the adapter name is also changed from wlan0 to wlan0mon, Now to proceed further we need to kill some process which may cause problem while we scan for availbale network or dump the data. to do that we just need to use **airmon-ng check kill** and it will kill the process which may cause problemin our way.

<font size="1">
<div style="height:180px;width:600px;overflow:auto;background-color:#262626;color:White;scrollbar-base-color:gold;font-family:monospace;padding:10px;">
<p><font color="red">root@kali</font>:<font color="RoyalBlue">~/Desktop</font># airmon-ng check kill</p>

<p>Killing these processes:</p>

</font>

<br>Now type **<font color="red">root@kali</font>:<font color="RoyalBlue">~/Desktop</font># airodump-ng wlan0mon** and we will start seeing Wifi APs which is available in our nearby surrounding.

<br>As we can see airodump is giving some usefull information for now let's only focus on our test setup as our ESSID which is **Teck_k2** which I set up for this blog and it's **BSSID(48:F8:B3:76:E6:E4)** which is the mac address of the AP, and it is running on **Channel 5**. It will be interesting if you can learn about Wlan Channels and learn about on which frquency which channel run like **2412Mhz** in channel one, then after the gave of 5 on **2417Mhz** it's channle 2, and so on.. from [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels) And also learn on which country which channle is ban.

<br>Now as we know the required information we can now check and analyse the traffic of our perticular AP and check how many machines are connected to it using Wifi.

<br>**<font color="red">root@kali</font>:<font color="RoyalBlue">~/Desktop</font># airodump-ng --bssid 48:F8:B3:76:E6:E4 --essid Teck_k2 -c 5 wlan0mon**

![4](https://teckk2.github.io/assets/images/Wifi/4.PNG)
<br>As you can see with our target AP I have connected my another Laptop for testing
<br>So now we need to capture the connection which is between the client and the AP, and for that we will create a deauth attack and when the client will try to reconnect to it's it will do a 4-way handshake and collect the IVs and that's what we need and later we can crack it, to understand this handshake process you can refer to [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11i-2004).
<br>Now we can do deauth attack on our target AP using **aireplay-ng**
<br>**<font color="red">root@kali</font>:<font color="RoyalBlue">~/Desktop</font># aireplay-ng -0 0 -a 48:F8:B3:76:E6:E4 -e Teck_k2 -h 98:22:EF:F0:90:79 wlan0mon**

<br>Where -a we used for BSSID, E is for SSID and -h is for station/client mac address, if we don't specify a client then it will deauth all the connected clients of the target IP and -0 0 is for deauth untill we stop it manually or we can also set the limit like 100 after -0 100 to send limited number of deauth.

<br>before starting the deauth we need to capture the traffic using airodump and write into a file with (-w) flag
<br>**<font color="red">root@kali</font>:<font color="RoyalBlue">~/Desktop</font># airodump-ng --bssid 48:F8:B3:76:E6:E4 --essid Teck_k2 -c 5 wlan0mon -w WEPCrack**
